# Corba Class Exersice for the class Parallel and Distributed Systems.
This is the corba implementation for our Distributed computing class. Applications can connect with one another using the middleware architecture known as CORBA, regardless of the programming languages, hardware, and software platforms, networks, or implementors on which they run.

CORBA objects, which implement interfaces defined in IDL, the interface defining language for CORBA, are the building blocks of applications.

RMI is used by clients to access the methods in the IDL interfaces of CORBA objects.

The Object Request Broker, or ORB, is the middleware element that enables RMI.

Members of the Object Management Group have funded the development of the CORBA standard (OMG).

The standard has been used to create several distinct ORBs that support a wide range of computer languages, including Java and C++.
